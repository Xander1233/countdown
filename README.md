# Countdown

A simple countdown timer with custom date support.

In order to use a custom date, you need to pass it as a query parameter, called `time`, with the URL.
If no date is passed, the timer will target the next New Years Eve.

The custom date supports all the formats that are supported by the vanilla JS `new Date` constructor. Read more about that in the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse#date_time_string_format).
